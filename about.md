*Last updated January 2024*

I'm not sure what to put here. Professional things are on my [resume](/resume),
and hobbies change often. Lately it's been:

- teaching and performing diabolo
- riding electric unicycle
- playing with my cat
- playing games on a free trial of Apple Arcade
- making better use of technology
- improving my Chinese
- browsing Wikipedia
- for the first time in my life, reading just to read and not under the influence of education systems

Books that I'm currently reading and maybe will never finish:

- "Exhalation: Stories" by Ted Chiang
- "The Worlds I See" by Dr. Fei-Fei Li
- "One, Two, Three... Infinity" by George Gamow
