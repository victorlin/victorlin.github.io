## MUSIC MASHUPS

- [youtube.com/c/VictorLin](https://youtube.com/c/VictorLin)

In the summer of 2013, I heard one of [Daniel Kim](https://www.youtube.com/user/kimaginati0n)'s mashups and took a shot at making my own. It wasn't a huge success, but I went for it again and did a year-end mashup of 54 pop songs. Since then it's been a tradition for me to do annual year-end mashups.

[Here](/billboard-vis) is a data visualization tool I made for [Billboard chart data](http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100).

## CHINESE YO-YO

Growing up, I learned Chinese yo-yo at a local Chinese school. In my first semester of college, I found a few other students who did it as a group at their high school. Now, we're a performance group putting on shows to audiences in the hundreds. We've also started a Chinese yo-yo club at the school for people who are interested in learning.
