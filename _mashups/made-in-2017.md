## Lyrics

Can't keep my hands to myself<br>
think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf<br>
in case my little baby girl is in need<br>
am I coming out of left field?<br>
(I tell all my hoes) ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now<br>
(break it down) I been feeling it since 1966, now<br>
(fuck it up, back it up, rake it up, back it up)<br>
but I feel it still...<br>
<br>
Despacito<br>
<br>
I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
we push and pull like a magnet do<br>
although my heart is falling too<br>
when I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts<br>
last night you were in my room<br>
and now my bedsheets smell like you<br>
every day discovering something brand new<br>
when I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts<br>
<br>
You know I love it when the music's loud<br>
but c'mon, strip that down for me (ooh yeah)<br>
baby, now there's a lot of people in the crowd<br>
but only you can dance with me<br>
so put your hands on my body<br>
and swing that round for me (ooh yeah)<br>
baby, you know I love it when the music's loud<br>
but c'mon, strip that down for me (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
<br>
Hey, mama, don't stress your mind<br>
we coming home tonight (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
hey, mama, we gonna be alright<br>
dry those eyes<br>
we'll be back in the morning when the sun starts to rise<br>
so mama, don't stress your mind<br>
so mama, don't stress your mind<br>
<br>
I got, I got, I –<br>
I got a condo in Manhattan<br>
baby girl, what's hatnin'?<br>
you and your ass invited<br>
so gon' and get to clappin'<br>
go pop it for a player, pop-pop it for me<br>
turn around and drop it for a player, drop-drop it for me<br>
<br>
Said little bitch<br>
you can't fuck with me, if you wanted to<br>
these expensive, these is red bottoms<br>
these is bloody shoes<br>
hit the store, I can get 'em both<br>
I don't wanna choose<br>
and I'm quick, cut a nigga hustle<br>
don't get comfortable, look<br>
<br>
(hop out) my bitch is bad and boujee (bad)<br>
(did you see my bag?) cookin' up dope with a Uzi (bwah)<br>
say I don't gotta dance<br>
I make money move (gah)<br>
(drop top) my bitch is bad and boujee (bad)<br>
(did you see my bag?) cookin' up dope with a uzi<br>
I'm a boss, you a worker bitch<br>
<br>
Now they always say congratulations<br>
worked so hard, forgot how to vacation<br>
they ain't never had the dedication<br>
people hatin', say we changed and look we made it<br>
yeah, we made it<br>
<br>
I've been poppin’, man I feel just like a rockstar<br>
<br>
I've got new rules, I count 'em<br>
I've got new rules, I count 'em<br>
<br>
Got me feelin' like<br>
ooh-ooh-ooh, been wishin' for you<br>
ooh ooh, promise me no promises<br>
I want you to hold me down<br>
ooh-ooh-ooh, been wishin' for you<br>
all of my heart is in Havana<br>
ooh ooh, promise me no promises<br>
<br>
Cold enough to chill my bones<br>
it feels like I don't know you anymore<br>
I don't understand why you're so cold to me<br>
with every breath you breathe<br>
I see there's something going on<br>
I don't understand why you're so cold<br>
<br>
But you don't judge me<br>
‘cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too<br>
d-d-d-dynamite<br>
until the sun goes up<br>
and I feel my love comin' up again<br>
<br>
I've got new rules, I count 'em<br>
I wanna be like, I wanna be like<br>
I've got new rules, I count 'em<br>
<br>
I wanna be like<br>
I like me better when I'm with you<br>
promise me no promises<br>
I like me better when I'm with you<br>
<br>
Say you won’t let go<br>
passionate from miles away<br>
so, rockabye baby, rockabye<br>
all you have to do is, all you have to is<br>
say you won’t let go<br>
passive with the things you say<br>
so, rockabye baby, rockabye<br>
I don't understand why you're so cold<br>
<br>
Look what you made me do<br>
look what you made me do<br>
(look at me) look what you just made me do<br>
look what you just made me do<br>
<br>
I wanna follow where she goes (don't act like you know me)<br>
I think about her and she knows it (I am not your homie)<br>
I wanna let her take control (don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah)<br>
‘cause every time that she gets close, yeah<br>
you don't know me // whatcha whatcha gonna do<br>
<br>
I've been running through the jungle<br>
I've been running with the wolves to get to you (get low)<br>
to get to you (get low)<br>
I've been down the darkest alleys<br>
saw the dark side of the moon to get to you (get low)<br>
just let me love you when your heart is tired<br>
<br>
I miss you, yeah I miss you<br>
(get low) just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby<br>
<br>
Get low, get low<br>
hands on your waist, let's go<br>
get low, get low<br>
just let me love you when your heart is tired<br>
